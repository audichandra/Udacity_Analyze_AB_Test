# Udacity_Analyze_AB_Test
In this project, I conducted A/B Hypothesis testing in determining whether the new website landing page design has better conversion rate than the old landing page design. First, I calculate the probability of the conversion manually using pandas with bayes probability.Then, on the second part, I conducted the A/B testing manually by performing one-tail hypothesis testing with 10,000 loop simulation of random sampling and find out that the this testing fail to reject the null hypothesis. At the third and final part, I used regression approach to test whether there is a significant effect of the new page design toward the conversion rate using the logistic regression.
